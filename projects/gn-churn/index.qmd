## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based machine learning application designed to predict customer churn at **GreyNoise Intelligence**. It serves as a modernized, deployable version of an initial analysis I conducted during an internship using R. The primary goal is to provide an interactive tool to assess churn risk in real-time.

To protect proprietary information, the public-facing version of this project, including the live app and the code repository, uses a synthetically generated dataset.

## Model Performance

The logistic regression model was validated using a **Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation** strategy. The metrics below reflect the performance on the original, proprietary dataset.

| Metric          | Score |
| :-------------- | :---- |
| **Mean Accuracy** | 0.79  |
| **Mean ROC AUC** | 0.70  |
| **Mean PR-AUC** | 0.54  |

An ROC AUC score of 0.70 demonstrates a good capability to distinguish between customers who will churn and those who will not. The PR-AUC score of 0.54 is particularly important for this imbalanced dataset, indicating that the model is substantially better at identifying churners than a random model.

## Key Predictive Factors

Analysis of the model's coefficients reveals the most significant factors influencing churn predictions.

#### Top Factors Increasing Churn Risk
1.  **Geographic Region:** The model identified that customers from certain geographic regions had a significantly higher propensity to churn.
2.  **Unknown Account History:** When a customer's prior account signup status was unknown, they were flagged as a high churn risk.
3.  **Specific Industry Segments:** Customers within certain specialized industries showed a higher tendency to churn.

#### Top Factors Decreasing Churn Risk
1.  **Acquisition Source:** Customers who came to GreyNoise via direct traffic were the least likely to churn.
2.  **Existing Account History:** Knowing a customer had a previous free account was a strong signal of loyalty and a significantly lower churn risk.
3.  **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** As a customer's ARR increased, their likelihood of churn decreased substantially.
