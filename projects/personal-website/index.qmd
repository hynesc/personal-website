## Project Overview

This project is the personal website you are currently viewing. The goal was to build a clean, professional, and easily maintainable site to showcase my data science portfolio.

Instead of using a traditional website builder, I chose to code the site from the ground up using **Quarto**, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. This approach allows for tight integration with data science workflows, enabling direct rendering of Jupyter Notebooks and R Markdown files into polished web pages.

## Key Features

-   **Automated Deployment**: The site is automatically built and deployed from its source code using **GitHub Actions**. Any `git push` to the main branch triggers a fresh build and publishes the changes live.
-   **Dynamic Project Listing**: The "Projects" page is a dynamic listing that automatically populates and creates filterable categories from the projects I add to the repository.
-   **Clean & Responsive Design**: The site uses a modern Quarto theme (`Flatly`) with custom CSS tweaks to ensure it is readable and looks great on any device, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **Integrated Code & Content**: The entire site, including all text, code, and project pages, is managed as plain text files (`.qmd`, `.ipynb`), making it version-controlled and easy to update.
