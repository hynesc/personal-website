## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow for predicting customer churn for TElco, a telecom company. It involves data cleaning, model training, feature importance analysis, and the deployment of an interactive web application using Streamlit.

By identifying at-risk customers, the business can proactively offer incentives or support to retain them, which is often more cost-effective than acquiring new customers.

## Key Features

-   **Interactive Prediction**: Use sliders and dropdowns to input customer data and receive a real-time churn prediction.
-   **Clear Results**: The app displays a clear, understandable prediction of whether a customer is likely to churn.
-   **Prediction Confidence**: Shows the model's confidence score (probability) for each prediction.
-   **Optimized Model**: Powered by a pruned logistic regression model that has been optimized through feature selection for efficiency and interpretability.

## Methodology

The project follows a standard data science workflow:

#### a. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- The `TotalCharges` column was converted to a numeric type, and rows with missing values were dropped.
- The non-predictive `customerID` column was removed.
- The target variable `Churn` was converted to a binary format (1/0).

#### b. Model Training and Feature Selection
- A **Logistic Regression** model was chosen for its effectiveness and high interpretability.
- A `ColumnTransformer` pipeline was used to automatically apply `StandardScaler` to numerical features and `OneHotEncoder` to categorical features.
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: The model's coefficients were analyzed, revealing that `gender`, `PhoneService`, and `Partner` had a negligible impact on predictive power.
- **Model Pruning**: A second, simpler model was trained with these unimportant features removed. This pruned model achieved the same performance (**F1-score of 0.61**) and was selected for the final application.
