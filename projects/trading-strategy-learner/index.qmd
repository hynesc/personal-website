* **Code Access:** Due to Georgia Tech academic policy, the source code for this project cannot be made public. However, I am happy to provide it and discuss the implementation upon request. Please feel free to contact me.

## Project Overview

This project develops and evaluates algorithmic trading strategies using technical indicators and machine learning. The primary goal was to build a "strategy learner" that could be trained on historical market data to generate profitable trading signals. The result was a fantastic learning experience and a stark reminder that I shouldn't become a day trader just yet. The project involved implementing core components from scratch, including a market simulator and a bagged random tree learning algorithm.

## Key Implementations

-   **Custom Algorithm Development:** Implemented a decision tree and a bagged random tree learning algorithm from scratch in Python.
-   **Market Simulator:** Created a basic market simulator to process stock trade orders (buy/sell) and track the value of a portfolio over time.
-   **Technical Indicator Engine:** Implemented several technical indicators to generate trading signals from historical price data, including Bollinger Bands (%B), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and a custom-designed volatility indicator (%ATR).
-   **Strategy Learner:** Used the technical indicators as features to train the bagged random tree model, optimizing it to maximize risk-adjusted returns.
-   **Comparative Analysis:** Conducted a thorough performance comparison between the machine-learning-driven strategy, a manually tuned strategy, and a benchmark buy-and-hold strategy on out-of-sample data.
